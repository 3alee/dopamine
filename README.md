# Dopamine

Dopamine is an audio player which tries to make organizing and listening to music as simple and pretty as possible. This version is written using Electron, Angular and Typescript. The original Dopamine (for Windows), which is written in WPF and C#, remains available <a href="https://github.com/digimezzo/dopamine-windows">here</a>.
